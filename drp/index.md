<h2 class="mb-3">Directed Reading Program</h2>

The Directed Reading Program pairs undergraduate students with
graduate student or postdoc mentors for independent reading projects. Each
reading project lasts the duration of a semester and culminates with
the undergraduate student giving a presentation. The content of the
project is decided on together by the student and the mentor.

This program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students to
dig deeper into a subject of their interest under the guidance of a knowledgeable 
graduate student or postdoc. For students interested in pursuing
undergraduate research this is a great first step! The DRP is a great way to decide
if a math major is right for you or to explore topics not covered by the regular courses at UVA.

<h2 class="mb-3">Requirements</h2>

The student is required to meet with their mentor once a week for an
hour to discuss their progress. Additionally four hours of independent
study is required each week. Finally, each
student will give a presentation about their project the next semester.
