### Projects Spring 2025:
1. **Compass and Straightedge Constructions** ([Evangelia Gazaki](https://sites.google.com/view/valiagazakihomepage/home), [Michael Wills](https://sites.google.com/view/michael-wills/))
This project will examine compass and straightedge constructions in the plane. We will use these tools to carry out explicit constructions (bisecting an angle, drawing a regular hexagon) as mathematicians have been doing for over 2000 years. Even as more and more constructions were discovered, some (such as constructing a square with the same area as a given circle) remained elusive. This project will also examine the seemingly distant branch of math known as _Galois theory_, and how it was used in the 1800's to show the mathematical impossibility of these famous open problems.
